### Problem statements:

 - The imagination power of every student is not same and while studying📚 some complicated subject including some very hard complex figures and diagrams it becomes very important to imagine the figure in reality.

### Proposed Solution✏️✏️
 - We will create an android app based on Augumented Reality(AR) where we are going to create a window where on just scanning the target image 3 virtual buttons will show up to the screen and on clicking the individual button you'll get different option for learning.
